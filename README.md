# GDP-Analysis
#The Project performs Exploratory Data Analysis on GSDP data of 2014-15.
#The Project is divided in two parts: 
  1. Part 1 uses State-wise Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at current price on yearly basis' data.
  2. Part 2 uses the Gross State Value Added (GSVA) and drop out  rate  of students in different states.
--The part 1 finds the average growth rate and top 5 GDP states and Bottom 5 states of each state in span of 2012-16.
--The Part 2 first combines data present in 30 files and contained to form a single dataframe.
--The dataframe consider the value for only 2014-15.
--The data is viualized to show the the percentage contributed by each sector namely Primary, Secondary and Tertiary in each state GSDP.
--The states are then grouped by the quantiles 0.2,0.5,0.8,1.0 as C1,C2,C3,C4.
--Then, the data is visualized on the basis of contribution of each sub-sector and analyzed how is contribution is different in each group namely c1,c2,c3 and c4. 
-- Then he data is again combined with the drop out rate of each state and it is analyze that how the drop out affect the GSDP of each state.
